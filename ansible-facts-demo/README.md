# Ansible Facts Demo

This playbook demonstrates how to use **Ansible facts** to gather system information and make decisions based on host properties.

## üìñ About Facts

- **Facts** are system information automatically collected by Ansible from managed hosts when a playbook runs.
- Examples: OS details, IP addresses, memory, CPU, SELinux status, etc.
- These can be used in conditions (`when:`), templates, and decision-making tasks.

You can list all facts with:

```bash
ansible all -i inventory -m setup
```

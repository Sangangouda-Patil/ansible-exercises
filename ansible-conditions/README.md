## What it Does

Gathers Facts (gather_facts: yes) â†’ Ansible automatically collects system information like OS family, memory, CPU, etc.

## Installs NTP/Chrony depending on the OS:

If os_family == "CentOS" â†’ installs chrony

If os_family == "Ubuntu" â†’ installs ntp

Starts and Enables Services:

For CentOS â†’ starts chronyd

For Ubuntu â†’ starts ntp

## (Optional but commented) â†’ Ensures these tasks only run if free RAM > 40% using facts like ansible_facts['memfree_mb'].

## ðŸ”¹ Why This is Useful

Portability â†’ Same playbook works across multiple OS types.

Resource-aware Deployment â†’ You can prevent installations on under-provisioned systems (low RAM).

Dynamic Playbooks â†’ Instead of hardcoding, you use system facts to make decisions.

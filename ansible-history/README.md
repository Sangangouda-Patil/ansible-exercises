# Ansible Playbook Execution Exercises

This README documents the exercises related to running and controlling Ansible playbooks using different command-line options.  
The focus here is on exploring **task listing, tags, skipping tasks, and step-by-step execution**.

---

## Key Learnings

Use --list-tasks and --list-tags to explore playbooks safely without execution.

Use --start-at-task to continue execution from a specific task.

Tags (--tags and --skip-tags) provide fine-grained control over task execution.

--step mode helps debug and verify tasks interactively.
